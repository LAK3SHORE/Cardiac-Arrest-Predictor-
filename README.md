Based on your anemia classification project, here's a GitHub README description:
Anemia Level Prediction in Children: Machine Learning Classification Analysis
Project Overview

This project applies supervised machine learning techniques to predict anemia severity levels in children using demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical features. The study demonstrates the application of computational learning methods in healthcare, specifically for early anemia detection and risk assessment.
Objective

Develop and compare classification models to predict anemia levels in pediatric populations, enabling healthcare professionals to identify at-risk children based on readily available demographic and clinical indicators.
Dataset & Preprocessing
Data Characteristics

    Total Records: 9,856 observations
    Training Set: 7,392 samples (75%)
    Test Set: 2,464 samples (25%)
    Target Variable: Anemia levels (4 classes: Not anemic, Mild, Moderate, Severe)

Feature Engineering

    Age Groups: Converted to interval means
    Residence Type: Binary encoding (Urban=1, Rural=0)
    Education Level: Mapped to years of education required
    Wealth Index: Ordinal encoding (0=Poorest, 4=Richest)
    Clinical Variables: Standardized Yes/No responses to binary
    Class Balancing: Applied RandomOverSampler for improved distribution

Data Cleaning

    Removed records with missing values using drop.na()
    Eliminated irrelevant features (marital status, breastfeeding timing)
    Converted all features to numerical format (int64/float64)

Model Performance Insights

The Random Forest Classifier achieved the highest performance (95% accuracy) due to its ensemble approach and ability to handle complex feature interactions. While this creates a "black box" model with limited interpretability, the superior predictive capability makes it valuable for clinical decision support systems.
